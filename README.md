# 📝 Crowd Counter Readme 🚀

Welcome to the Crowd Counter program! This Python application utilizes the p2pnet model to calculate the number of people in a crowd based on an input image. The program marks each and every entity in the crowd with a point and provides the total count of individuals as the program output. 🙆‍♂️🙆‍♀️

## 🛠️ Setup

To set up the Crowd Counter program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine. 💻
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 📦
3. Make sure you have the p2pnet model files available in the correct directory. 🗂️
4. Run the program using `python crowd_counter.py`. 🏃‍♂️💨

## 🖼️ Input Image

Ensure you provide a clear image of the crowd as the input. The program will process the image and identify each person present. 📸👥

## ⚙️ Output

The output generated by the Crowd Counter program will be an annotated image that marks each entity in the crowd with a point. Additionally, it will display the total number of persons detected in the crowd. 🖊️✨

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the program using the setup instructions mentioned above. 🏃‍♂️💨
2. Provide the input image when prompted. 📸
3. Wait for the program to process the image and generate the output. ⌛️
4. Once completed, the annotated image will be displayed, showing each individual marked with a point, and the total count will be shown as output. 🎉
